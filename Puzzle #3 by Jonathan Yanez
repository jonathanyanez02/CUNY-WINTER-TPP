//Create a function that takes a number as a parameter. This function will print out (console.log()) every number from 1 to the number passed as the parameter, now:
//if the number is divisible by 3 then the function will print out the word 'Fizz' instead of the number.
//if the number is divisible by 3 and 5 then the function will print out the word 'Fizz Buzz' instead of the number.

//Previous code was not running and ran into many bugs



<script>
 

for ( var x = 1; x < 101; x++ ) {
  
  
  var checkForThree = x % 3;// checks if its divisable by 3
  var checkForFive = x % 5;// checks if its divisable by 5
  
  // if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, then print FizzBuzz
  if ( (checkForThree == 0) && (checkForFive == 0) ) 
  	console.log( "FizzBuzz");
  
  // if the number is divisible by 3, then print Fizz
  else if (checkForThree == 0)
    console.log( "Fizz");
  
  // if the number is divisible by 5, then print Buzz
  else if (checkForFive == 0)
    console.log( "Buzz");
  
  // otherwise just print the number
  else
    console.log( x );
