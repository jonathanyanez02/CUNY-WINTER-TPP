//Julius Caesar protected his confidential information by encrypting it using a cipher. Caesar's cipher shifts each letter by a number of letters. If the shift takes you past the end of the alphabet, just rotate back to the front of the alphabet. In the case of a rotation by 3, w, x, y, and z would map to z, a, b and c. Code the Caesar Cipher in Javascript and submit it here.



function ceasarsCipher(text){ //passes a string value
    let result = ""; //sets result to string
    Text = text.toLowerCase();
    for (let x = 0; x < text.length; x++){ //iterates through text
        let index = newalpha.indexOf(text[I]); 
        result += alphabet[index];
    }
    return result; //returns result
}
